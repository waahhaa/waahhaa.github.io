  Hi, my name is Anthony Tan and I'm a DevOps Engineer. I am a passionate DevOps engineer with a relentless drive for optimizing software development and deployment processes. My journey in the world of technology has been nothing short of an exciting adventure, and I take pride in my ability to bridge the gap between development and operations, making software delivery more efficient, reliable, and scalable. With a background in software development, I have cultivated a deep understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. My expertise lies in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure as code, and cloud computing.
