  Hi, Anthony here and I'm a DevOps Engineer. I am a passionate DevOps engineer with a relentless drive for optimizing software development and deployment processes. My journey in the world of technology has been nothing short of an exciting adventure, and I take pride in my ability to bridge the gap between development and operations, making software delivery more efficient, reliable, and scalable. With a background in software development, I have cultivated a deep understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. My expertise lies in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure as code, and cloud computing.

          Co-led with Sect Hd to architect the automated deployment of OKD cluster in Production Environment via Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Resulting in large reduction of time (From at least 8 hours to 1 hour) needed to deploy a new cluster in the event of failures.

          Cost saving, self-build staging environment using re-purposed baremetal and opensource tools.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Planned and directed the team to re-purpose existing bare metal servers for the deployment of new OKD clusters. This cost saving staging environment employs free opensource developer tools and minimally mirrors the production environment. Allowing product teams to easily test out their applications before production. Increases confidence level and user experience when product team launches new releases.
